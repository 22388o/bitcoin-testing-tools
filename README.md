# bitcoin-testing-tools

This repository aims to provide a bitcoin test framework based on signet.
Docker is extensively used to provide:
* a bitcoin node that mines bitcoin on a custom signet
* a bitcoin node that downloads the custom signet chain (can be used to test bitcoin layer-2 software)
* a core-lightning node
